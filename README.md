### Hi to all visitors of my GitHub profile

- Currently I'm primarily working on 
  * [Maven IT Extension](https://github.com/khmarbaise/maven-it-extension)
  * [Mojo Haus](https://github.com/mojohaus) some particular issues related
    releases (currently [mojo-parent](https://github.com/mojohaus/mojo-parent)) and updates
    in the parent. 
    Afterwards I will continue to [versions-maven-plugin](https://github.com/mojohaus/versions-maven-plugin)
    to get the release process upgraded as well.
